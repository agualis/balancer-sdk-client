# Balancer SDK client

Vue3 + Typescript + vite application that consumes balancer libraries (SDK, SOR, ...).

## Commands

Assuming that both `balancer-sdk-client` and `balancer-sor` are located in the same local directory, run:

```bash
npm run build-local
```

to build and visualize how changes in the SOR dependency affect to the client bundle.
